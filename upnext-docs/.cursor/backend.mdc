## API Design
- Use RESTful endpoints for MVP simplicity.
- Group endpoints by function (e.g. `/projects`, `/uploads`, `/auth`).
- Validate inputs at the handler level.

## Supabase Auth
- Use Supabase Auth for login/signup flows.
- Protect endpoints using access tokens or session validation.

## Storage
- Store all uploaded videos in Supabase Storage.
- Attach metadata like: version, project ID, uploadedBy, fileType.
- Optionally watermark or flag drafts via metadata.

## Database
- Use PostgreSQL via Supabase or Prisma.
- Define clean models for users, projects, content, versions.
- Consider soft-deleting over hard-deleting content (track state).
