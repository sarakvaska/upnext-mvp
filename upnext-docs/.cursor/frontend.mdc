## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes over custom CSS.
- Ensure all pages and components are mobile responsive.
- Avoid deeply nested styles — keep layout clear.

## Component Design
- Keep components small and composable.
- Place reusable UI elements in `/components`.
- Use PascalCase for component files and folder names.

## Routing & Views
- Route views live in `/app`, use file-based routing conventions.
- Use kebab-case for folder names in routing.
- Group related pages into logical subfolders.

## Misc
- Use `clsx` or similar helpers for conditional classNames.
- Avoid unnecessary prop drilling — lift state as needed.
